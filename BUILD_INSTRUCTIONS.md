# Building the SDK

See instructions for your platform:

## Compiling
When following the instructions for Windows, VS2022 is now the minimum requirement so the instructions to
download/install VS2013 is no longer needed and replaced by just downloading/installing VS2022 instead. Make sure
to at least include the C++ Development tools during VS2022 installation.
